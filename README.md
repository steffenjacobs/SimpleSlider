# SimpleSlider
A simple Slider implemented in native GWT with divs. It supports setting the position, adding/removing event handlers, setting size and changing the bar color.

When you click on the slider, the position is changed. Additionally, you can drag with the mouse to set a specified position. There is a small 100ms-animation when you set a new position on the slider via clicking. During this animation, the slider moves to the new position.
